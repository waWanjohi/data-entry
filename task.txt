You have been assigned to design and develop a RESTful API for a multiuser data entry application. 
The API should allow for multiple categories of data, including 
    => Health Institutions 
    => Professional Details
    => Event Details 
with the option to add additional categories as needed. 
The items within each category should be unique and searchable/filterable. 
You are expected to research the item's details based on the category.


The deliverables for this project include the following:
- A database design
- A link to a code repository that includes the API
- Unit tests with at least 80% test coverage
- A Readme file explaining how to set up and run the application
-- Bonus points will be awarded for implementing a CI pipeline or GitHub flow.
